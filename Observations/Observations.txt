From the pysc2 environment.md documentation

obs.observation is a dictionary that contains:
    screen, available_actions, cargo_slots_available, player,
    minimap, multi_select, game_loop, cargo, score_cumulative,
    single_select, build_queue, control_groups

Observations are literally what is currently going on in the game 
that can be seen by the player agent. 

Minimap: the minimap consists of an array that shows various units
	from player ids, friendly and hostile units visibility, etc

Screen: shows information directly on the screen and has many of the 
	same variables as minimap. But also has many more variables 
	such as, hit points, energy, shields, etc

General Player Info: another array that has player_id, minearls, food used
	food used by workers, idle worker count, army count, etc

Available Actions: array that lists all action ids available at time of 
	observation. Observations taken presumably every frame
