MultiSelect

-  Multi-select observations are used to show the stats
   of the current group of units selected.

-  Using the action SELECT_ARMY you can select your
   army and the multi-select observations will show 
   the stats of each unit. 

-  The multi-select observations returns a tensor
   meaning that in order to see individual stats
   like health you must treat it as a double array.

-  obs.observations['multi-select'][0] will return 
   all the stats of the first unit in the group that
   has been selected.

-  The stats are ordered [unit type, player_relative,
   health, shields, energy, transport, build progress]

-  The stats important to us are the player_relative
   and health. player_relative equals 1 if it is our 
   unit and equals 4 if it is an enemy unit. 

-  To access player_relative or health individually
   you can access the element in the array with the
   correct index using obs.observations['multi-select'][0][1]
   for player_relative and obs.observations['multi-select][0][2]
   for health. 

-  Using SELECT_ARMY will result in selecting units only within 
   your army, so you will only see units with a player_relative
   value of 1. 

-  You can also use the command SELECT_RECT to select an area 
   on the screen to select units. Using this command can result
   in selecting units from both your army and the enemy army. 

Single Select

-  Single select observations are to show the stats of the currently 
   selected unit. 

-  This is done similarly to the multi-select observation, but you 
   don't have to treat it as a double array. 
   calling obs.observation['single-select'] will show all the stats
   of the currently chosen unit. 

-  You can check for individual values, such as player_relative, by
   calling obs.observation['single-select'][1]
