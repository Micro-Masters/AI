Minimap

-  The minimap shows all the units that can currently
   be seen through the fog of war. The minimap is also
   a tensor that shows [height_map, visibility, creep, 
   camera, player_id, player_relative, selected] 

-  The elements important to us are the player_relative 
   values and the selected values. 

-  Unlike the Multi-Select and Single-Select tensors, the
   elements in the Minimap are all separated into their own 
   arrays. I can access all of the values of player relative with
   obs.observation['feature_minimap'][4] 
   This will give me the individual values of all units on the map
   and I will be able to see if they are enemy units or my units. 

-  One easy way cut the array down to just enemy units is to call .nonzero()
   (obs.observation['feature_minimap'][4] == 4).nonzero() will return all
   entries that are nonzero and are equal to the number 4 which indicates
   the unit is an enemy unit. 

-  The "smart attacking agent" tutorial we used even found the locations
   of the enemies by doing:
	enemy_y, enemy_x = (obs.observation['feature_minimap'][4] == 4).nonzero()

Screen

-  The Screen can be used similarly to the Minimap. However, it also contains more 
   information than the minimap. 

-  The Screen has a tensor larger than the minimap conatining: [height_map, visibility, creep, power,
   player_id, player_relative, unit_type, selected, hit_points, energy, shields, 
   unit_density, unit_density_aa

-  Again, the values that are important to us on the screen are player_relative, 
   selected, and hit_points.

-  Also, similarly to the minimap the indexes of the tensor are their own tensors that 
   contain the values of all the units for the specified tensor. 

-  To access all of the values of player_relative on the screen simply call
	obs.observation['feature_screen'][5]//notice that the index number is 
        different from the minimap.
