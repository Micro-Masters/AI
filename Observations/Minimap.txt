MultiSelect

-  Multi-select observations are used to show the stats
   of the current group of units selected.

-  Using the action SELECT_ARMY you can select your
   army and the multi-select observations will show 
   the stats of each unit. 

-  The multi-select observations returns a tensor
   meaning that in order to see individual stats
   like health you must treat it as a double array.

-  obs.observations['multi-select'][0] will return 
   all the stats of the first unit in selected.

-  The stats are ordered [unit type, player_relative,
   health, shields, energy, transport, build progress]

-  The stats important to us are the player_relative
   and health. player_relative equals 1 if it is our 
   unit and equals 4 if it is an enemy unit. 

-  We can use multi-select to keep track of our units'
   health as well as enemy health if we select enemies.
