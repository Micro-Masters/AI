Jeffrey's Log

5/29/18:

- Looked into receiving enemy data so that we could
  make decisions based on it. 

- Bot that we used in tutorials would not select
  enemies so looking into enemy data was impossible
  with current bot, so attempted tweaking the bot
  in order to select enemies, but ran into problems.

- We can see player data though, so I made a text 
  file explaining how. 

- Also took the list of 523 actions and tried to 
  cut it down to actions that would most benefit 
  us. There are still many actions that I do not
  know the effect of and there are also some that 
  do not apply to us simply because of the race type.
