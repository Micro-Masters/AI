For the week of 5/8/18 - 5/15/18

- Downloaded all the packages needed to work on my part (model for close quarter battle), except the A2C package
	-> got the error of "run.py does not exist" when running the command "python3 run.py my_experiment --map MoveToBeacon"
	-> it seems like it was because the baseline folder provided on https://github.com/openai/baselines was outdated
	-> currently finding solution to mitigate the problem
- Experimented with starcraft map building tools
- Started tutorials on how to build different types of agents e.g. basic, smart, sparse attak agents using pysc2
	-> using tutorials on https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial
- Read article on how to use A2C, and basic understanding of A2C
	-> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf
