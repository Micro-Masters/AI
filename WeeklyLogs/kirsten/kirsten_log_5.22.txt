For the week of 5/16/18 - 5/22/18

- created killtanks.SC2Map
  - better than previous map becuase it has modified win conditions
  - only need to kill all tanks to win (lose if all zerglings die)
  - no buildings or unit creating, just microing the given units  
  - https://github.com/Micro-Masters/AI/commit/4aa24dc0fdbd150ac9cc60331f489c1076c30053
- begining to combine things I've learned from tutorials that introduced the
  pysc2 bot building mechanisms with simple a2c implementation examples. (still
  early in this process though.)
