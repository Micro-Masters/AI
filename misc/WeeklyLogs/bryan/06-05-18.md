# Bryan's Log

For week 9-10
  - figured out how to access feature units
    - note, myself and Kirsten found a strange bug that caused a recursive 
error whenever we tried to access certain observations like so: 
`obs[0].observation.feature_minimap`. 
    - The same bug was encountered by other people in the starcraft community,
so we know that we weren't alone in this. The bug has been reported to people
in the Starcraft II AI Discord server.
    - a workaround we found was to typecast the original data structure, a
`NamedNumpyArray` to a `numpy.array`.
      - doing so enabled us to access elements of that data structure without
the strange recursive error.
