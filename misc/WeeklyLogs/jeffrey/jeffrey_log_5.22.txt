Jeffrey's Log

5/22/18:

- Looked over documentation of actions and observations
  that are used and seen by the agents in order to better
  understand how to implement our bot for our current goals.

- Modified the random_agent given by the pysc2 repo in 
  order to print out observations seen during the game. 

- Also tried modifying attack_agent created by the tutorials
  we followed, but not too many new observations were recorded
  by the smarter agent.
