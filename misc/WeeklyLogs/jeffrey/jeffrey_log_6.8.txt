- My work was done doing research for the Observations so I moved onto 
  trying to get unit testing done. 

- Originally I tried getting pytest to work, but I ran into some issues
  so instead I used they python module unittest. 

- I made unit tests for our observation modifier and reward modifier
  basically just checking to make sure that the observations are 
  being changed and the rewards are either changing or staying the 
  same, because they should be the same with certain actions taken. 

- I also tried to make unit tests for our agent, but since the agent
  had some problems I was unable to finish the unit tests for it.
