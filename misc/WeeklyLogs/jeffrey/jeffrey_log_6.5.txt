Jeffrey's Log

6/5/18:

- Created a script that moves the camera to where the
  enemy location is. This is going to be used so that we
  can move the camera with our bot in order to collect
  information on the enemy and help our bot make decisions

- Expanded guide for how to interface with the observations
  and actions so that we could go into having our bot make
  smart decisions.

- Honestly kind of back-pedaled this week. I was completely
  focused on how the observations and actions worked in the 
  tutorial bots that we made, so when we moved on to our 
  bot and the observations were extracted differenly I was 
  completely thrown off. 
  My teammates figured out how to get the feature_units,
  but we still need to be able to move the screen around and
  such, so we'll need to figure out how to access the minimap.

- For right now the only observations we can easily get are 
  Available_Actions, Last_Actions, and feature_units.

- This week I'll need to do some research into how to get the 
  rest of the units.
