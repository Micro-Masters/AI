- Followed tutorials on this website in order to 
  create a simple bot and a smart bot in PySC2.

- Our group found a project called A2C that we plan to also 
  use as a baseline for our project to build off of. 
  However, I have been unable to get it working on 
  my personal device.

- Read over articles on A2C and different bot implementations.
