Feature Units

-  Feature Units is a newly added observation that we can
   use to check the stats of the units that appear on the
   screen. 

-  There are 25 stats that the feature_units show us,
   but we only need a couple. 

-  The stats that are important to us are the 
   health and the alliance. 

-  Alliance is the same thing as the player_relative 
   value used in the other observations. 

-  We can access feature unit the same way that we access
   the other observations.
   obs.observation['feature_unit'] and to get health we do
   obs.observation['feature_unit'][2] and to get alliance
   obs.observation['feature_unit'][1]

-  Using feature unit is easier than trying to select the
   enemies in order to get their health. 

-  This way we only need to look at the enemies in order to 
   get their health. 

-  To find out if the units are allied with the enemy 
   simply do obs.observation['feature_unit'][1] == 4
